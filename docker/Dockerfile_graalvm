# Dockerfile to build an image that runs the GraalVM native-image compiler. We
# need to do this because native-image only builds on the platform on which it
# runs. Hence if we want to build Linux binaries on a different machine we need
# to create a Linux VM that does this. This is what we are doing here.
#
# To build this image, run:
#
#   docker build -t graalvm-native-image .
